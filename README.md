/*
	LRUCache : Least Recently Used Cache Mock

		A cache is a component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster.
		The data stored in a cache might be the results of an earlier computation, or the duplicates of data stored elsewhere.
		A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot.
		Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store.
		Thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.

		One of the popular cache replacement policies is: "least recently used" (LRU). It discards the least recently used items first.

		For example, if a cache with a capacity to store 5 keys has the following state(arranged from most recently used key to least recently used key) -

		5 3 2 1 4

		Now, If the next key comes as 1(which is a cache hit), then the cache state in the same order will be -

		1 5 3 2 4

		Now, If the next key comes as 6(which is a cache miss), then the cache state in the same order will be -

		6 1 5 3 2
